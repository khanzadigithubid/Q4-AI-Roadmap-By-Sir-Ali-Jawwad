üß† What is Function Calling?
Function Calling means you manually run a function in your code to perform a task. There‚Äôs no AI involved ‚Äî it‚Äôs you, the developer, doing everything.

Example:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5
‚û°Ô∏è You wrote the function and called it yourself.
‚û°Ô∏è This is called manual function calling.
‚û°Ô∏è It‚Äôs common in normal programming.

ü§ñ What is Tool Calling?
Tool Calling happens when an AI model (like ChatGPT) automatically chooses to call a tool (a registered function) based on what the user says.

Example:
def get_weather(city):
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."
Then, the user says:
"What‚Äôs the weather in Lahore?"

The AI sees your question and thinks:
‚ÄúI should use the get_weather function.‚Äù

It automatically runs:

get_weather("Lahore")
And then replies:
"The weather in Lahore is sunny."

‚û°Ô∏è You didn‚Äôt call the function. The AI did it for you.
‚û°Ô∏è The tool was already registered (with @tool), so the AI knew it could use it.
‚û°Ô∏è This is used in Agentic AI and intelligent chatbots.

Function Calling vs Tool Calling (Explained Simply)
In Function Calling, you are writing code and directly calling functions.

In Tool Calling, the AI looks at what the user asks and decides which tool (function) to use.

Function Calling is manual.

Tool Calling is automatic and AI-powered.

What is a Registered Tool?
A registered tool is a special function you tell the AI it's allowed to use.

You register it like this:

def translate(text, lang):
    return f"Translated '{text}' to {lang}"
If you don‚Äôt register the function, the AI doesn‚Äôt know it exists.

Behind-the-Scenes Example:
User says:
"Convert 100 USD to PKR"

AI thinks:
"I should use a tool like convert_currency()"

It runs:

convert_currency("USD", "PKR", 100)
Tool returns: "27500 PKR"

AI replies: "100 USD is approximately 27,500 PKR."

All of this is automatic. You just ask, and the AI does the work!

Final Summary (In Simple Words)
Function = A piece of code you write.

Function Calling = You call that code yourself.

Tool = A function registered for AI to use.

Tool Calling = AI chooses and runs the tool automatically.

Registered Tool = A function marked for AI access using something like @tool.

‚úÖ Final Verdict
Every time an AI does Tool Calling, it's really just doing Function Calling behind the scenes ‚Äî but it's deciding when and how to use it.

So, Function Calling = manual by you
Tool Calling = automatic by AI
